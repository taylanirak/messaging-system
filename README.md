Username has to be Taylan, Cevher or Ä°smet but you can change with your own databaase. For messages, you can either send, list or read them. There are text files which you can access even if you close the connection and they are for each user's Inbox folders and Sent folders. 
send:receivers name:subject:body
list:Inbox or list:Sent  (to see what the folders have)
read:sequence number   (you can see the sequence number in server's side, it is not the index of the message though. Every message has its unique sequence number and you can find it from the Server's side.)
